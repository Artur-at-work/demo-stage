					<blockquote>"You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to 
						accomplish what is now being done, the saving of 
						many lives." [Genesis 50:20]  </blockquote> 
						 </B>
						<P>My Taiwanese name is Lin Huan-Chun (林奐均). My English  
						name is Judy. I was born in Taipei, Taiwan. I had a very loving family: 
						 my parents, my grandmother, and two sisters who were twins, 3 years 
						younger than me. Even when I was very young, I knew that I was my 
						grandmother's favorite. She loved me, spoiled me, and I went with 
						her everywhere, including the Buddhist temples she would visit. My 
						grandmother was a very devout Buddhist and together we would go to 
						temples to burn incense, bow down to the idols, offer sacrifices. </P>
						
						<P>Life seemed carefree and easy until I was about 8 years old. Taiwan at
						the time was going through a lot of political turmoil. The country was
						under martial law and there was a lot of fear amongst the people. My dad
						was a human rights activist and involved in an underground newspaper. The
						government hated him and eventually put him in jail for his democratic
						ideals. Nobody told me that my father had gone to jail. He just
						disappeared one day, and people told me he had gone to the army. But
						little kids are smart. I knew something was very wrong.</P>
						
						<P>Then several months later, on February 28, 1980, the event happened 
						that would forever change our lives. I walked home from school and rang
						the doorbell 
						and strangely enough, no one answered the door. I kept ringing and 
						ringing and then sat down on the front step to wait for someone to answer 
						the door. </P>
						<P>A long time went by and then a stranger opened the 
						door from the inside. I was used to our house having lots of guests, so I 
						thought nothing of the stranger. I went inside and headed straight for my 
						bedroom, only thinking of laying down my very heavy bookbag. </P>
						
						<P>As 
						I went into my bedroom, all of a sudden I felt like I needed to quickly 
						swerve. I believe it was God warning me. I swerved just as the stranger 
						plunged at me with a knife. If I hadn't swerved at that moment, and 
						if I hadn't had my bookbag on, that first stab would have been 
						fatal. The man continued to stab me as I tried to hide under the table 
						and pleaded with him to stop. After he had stabbed me seven, eight times, 
						my grandmother came into the house and called for me. The man locked me 
						in my room so that no one would be able to reach me. Then he went out to 
						my grandmother and I heard them struggle in a fight. I heard my 
						grandmother scream my name, "Huan-Chun!" I tried to answer her, but I was 
						too weak to make any sounds. I didn't know it at the time, but my
						grandmother died with 13 stabs on her body. To this day I know my
						grandmother loved me very much because my name were her last words. </P>
						
						<P>Meanwhile, I was bleeding a lot in my 
						room and I thought of getting help. Right outside of my bedroom window 
						was a fence and beyond the fence was the street. There was a market right 
						across the street. I thought that if I could just climb up on the window 
						and hop over the fence, people would see me on the street and come and 
						help us. So I tried to jump from my window, but my body was too weak. I 
						landed between the window and the fence. Then I thought, "OK, if I'm 
						going to die, then I want to die on my parents' bed." So I crawled 
						to the backdoor of my parents' bedroom and onto their bed and 
						awaited death. </P>
						
						<P>All this time, my mother had been visiting my 
						father in jail. She had been calling our house and was getting worried 
						because nobody was answering the phone. She sent my dad's former 
						secretary to come and check up on us. The secretary discovered me on my 
						parents' bed. I told her a thief had come to our house and that I 
						was very thirsty. She let me sip a little water from a handkerchief and 
						called the ambulance and I was sent to the hospital. I spent a long time 
						at the hospital, and by the grace of God I lived.</P>
						
						<P>My parents 
						tried to keep me from knowing the terrible things that had happened. But 
						about a year later, my mother took me aside and told me that my 
						grandmother had died and that both of my sisters were also killed. I wept 
						and wept that day. How I longed for just five more minutes with them to 
						tell them that I loved them. I cried for many hours. After I finished
						crying, I got up and made a vow: I'm going to be strong for my
						parents and I'm never going to cry again. Even though I was only 8 
						or 9 years old at the time, I was determined to never cry, and never be
						vulnerable again. </P>
						
						<P>And indeed, I didn't cry for many years. 
						I hardened my heart and began to grow bitter. Even at a young age, I 
						would sometimes lie awake and try to remember what the murderer's 
						face looked like. I wanted to remember his face so that one day when I 
						grew up, I would find him and shoot him myself. I became fiercely 
						independent.</P>
						
						<P>Two years later, my mother and I came to the United 
						States. I started going to church and my heart began to be softened. I 
						had great youth group leaders and Sunday school teachers and through the 
						Bible they began to introduce me to Jesus Christ. </P>
						
						<P>As I studied 
						the Bible, God's truth began to penetrate me and it seemed like God 
						Himself was asking me questions: "Do you believe that Jesus is the Son of 
						God? Do you believe that Jesus is the Savior of the world? Do you believe 
						that God loves you so much that he died for you? Do you want God to come 
						into your heart and be your Lord?" As I continued to read the Bible and 
						consider carefully, I became convinced of the Truth. And as God gave me 
						faith to believe, I began to answer those questions, "Yes, I believe the 
						Bible is true. Yes, I believe that Jesus is the only true Savior. Yes, I 
						want Jesus to come into my heart and I want to follow him as my Lord." So 
						sometime in high school, through a gradual process, I believed in Jesus 
						Christ and became a Christian. </P>
						
						<P>I've been a Christian for 
						ten years now. God has continued to love me and draw me to Himself. God 
						has never abandoned me and he has continued to work on my heart. I'd 
						like to share with you three things that God has taught me. </P><DIR>
						
						<OL>
						 <LI>The first thing: Remember that resolve I made 8  
						years earlier, that I was never going to cry again? For 8 years I closed 
						my heart and refused to cry. Well, God melted my hard heart and began to 
						show me how to cry again. As I would share with people about God and how 
						much he had brought me through, I actually started to cry. And as I 
						cried, an amazing thing happened, I became vulnerable again and I was 
						healed. God taught me how to cry and healed me.</LI><p>
						 <LI>The second 
						thing: I began to have forgiveness in my heart. This was incredible, that 
						I was actually able to forgive this murderer who had hurt my family so 
						much. God removed my hatred and bitterness and replaced it with his love 
						and his forgiveness. There is absolutely no way that I was able to 
						forgive this man on my own strength. It was God's doing alone. 
						 </LI> 
						<p>
						 <LI>The third thing: I learned that I was a sinner. As I began my 
						life with God, I learned that God loved me so much that he sacrificed his 
						one and only son for me. Why such sacrifice? Why did Jesus have to die on 
						the cross for me? Because I am a sinner. I am full of pride instead of 
						humility. I am self-centered instead of other-centered. I hate instead of 
						love. I am full of sin. And yet, God loves me, the sinner. Instead of me, 
						Judy, paying for my own deserved punishment, God sent Jesus to pay for 
						my sins by dying for me. And because I have put my faith in Jesus, I am 
						forgiven. His sacrifice, his blood, washes me clean of all my sins. 
						 </LI>
						</OL>
						<P>On my wedding CD, I sing a favorite hymn of mine called "There 
						is a Fountain." The first verse says, "There is a fountain filled with 
						blood drawn from Immanuel's veins." This fountain is filled with 
						Jesus' precious blood. "And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose 
						all their guilty stains." When we plunge or dive into this 
						fountain, his blood washes us clean. Everyone of us is a sinner. What we 
						need is to be forgiven. And what we need is a Savior, Jesus Christ. </P>
						
						<P>In conclusion, I want to share a verse from Genesis with you, Genesis 
						50:20. The end of Genesis is about the life of Joseph, a man who 
						experienced lots of tragedy in his life. His brothers sold him into 
						slavery, he was falsely accused and spent a long time in prison. Yet God 
						eventually brought him from the depths into an exalted position, where he 
						became Second-in-Command to Egypt's Pharaoh. God used Joseph in his 
						position to store up lots of food. Then when 7 years of severe famine 
						hit, Joseph was able to save the people from starving to death. God used 
						Joseph to save lots of lives. Eventually, Joseph met his brothers again, 
						the same brothers who hated him and sold him into slavery. The brothers 
						were afraid that Joseph was going to seek revenge. But instead, this is 
						what Joseph replied in Genesis 50:20, "You intended to harm me, but God 
						 intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of  
						many lives." </P>
						
						<P>This is how I view my past. Though I've 
						had tragedies in my life, God intended it for good. I can look back on my 
						life and say "Thank you God for bringing me from darkness to light. Thank 
						you God for healing me and bringing me joy and purpose in life. Thank you 
						God for loving me so much and forgiving me through Jesus." </P>
						
						<P>I hope 
						that my story will encourage everyone of you to search and find that 
						Jesus Christ is real. He is the Savior. He is the truth. All who believe 
						on him will never perish but have eternal life. </P>
						
						<P>This is my testimony to the greatness of God.</p>
